# 💻 ES6 Practice

The exercises in this repository will give you a chance to practice the things you've learned from the videos. Be sure you watch those first, so you know what to expect.

## 📝 Editing You Code

You will need to open your repository in Gitpod which is an IDE that runs in your browser. This is exactly the same setup we will use for future development, so it's good to get familiar with it now.

To open your respository, prefix the url for this repository with `gitpod.io/#`.

## 🧪 Testing Your Code

To test your code execute `yarn test` in terminal. All tests will run and you will be given feedback about passing and failing tests.

As you work through each set of problems, it may be useful to run tests on only what you are currently working on. To run on just one set of problems execute `yarn test Practice-A` in terminal. Of course change the last letter to match the set you are working on.

## 📁 Submitting Your Code

Use the Source Control tab to add and commit your changes. Each change should be a seperate commit.

Push your changes to GitHub often so I can provide feedback.
